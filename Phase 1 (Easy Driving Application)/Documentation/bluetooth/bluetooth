Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances from fixed and mobile devices.
WHY WE USE BLUETOOTH MODULE?
To enable us to communicate with our controller arduino in order to take orders from our mobile application.
HC-05 bluetooth module consist of 6 pins :
we used 4 pins : 1.5v taken from arduino. 2. ground connected to ground of circuit. 3.RX connected to TX of arduino 4.TX connected to RX of arduino.
RX connected to TX and vice versa as in our project bluetooth module transmits(TX) orders recieved by arduino(RX).
